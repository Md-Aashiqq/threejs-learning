# Geometry

    => Composed of vertices (point coordinates in 3D spaces) and faces (triangle that join those vertices to create a surface)

    => Can be used for meshes but also for particles
    => Can store more data than the position(UV coordinates , normals , colors or anything we want) 

## Built In Geometry

    => All the geometry inherit from Geometry

## Box Geometry

    => Just a box Geometry

## Plane Geometry

## Circle Geometry

## Cone Geometry

## Cylinder Geometry

## Ring Geometry

## Torus Geometry

## TorusKnot Geometry

## Dodecahedron Geometry
